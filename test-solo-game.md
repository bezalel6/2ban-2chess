# Solo Game Fix Verification

## Changes Made

### Problem

Solo games were showing a color mismatch where:

- The server always sent `playerColor: 'white'` for solo games
- But the game state had turns alternating between white and black
- This caused the debug panel to show "Your Color: white" even when it was black's turn

### Solution

1. **Server-side (`server/ws-server.ts`)**:
   - Updated to send the current turn as the player color for solo games
   - When joining or reconnecting to a solo game, the color now matches the current turn from the FEN

2. **Client-side (`lib/ws-hooks.ts`)**:
   - When receiving a 'state' update for solo games, the playerColor is now updated to match the current turn
   - This ensures the color stays synchronized as the game progresses

3. **ChessBoard component** (already correct):
   - Was already handling solo games correctly by using `fenData.turn` for orientation

## Testing Steps

1. Start a new solo game
2. Check that the debug panel shows:
   - "Your Color" matches "Current Turn"
   - The board orientation changes with each move (white perspective when white's turn, black perspective when black's turn)
3. Make a move and verify:
   - The board flips to the opposite perspective
   - "Your Color" updates to match the new turn
4. Continue playing and verify the color/turn synchronization remains correct

## Expected Behavior

- In solo games, the player always plays from the current turn's perspective
- The debug panel should always show matching "Current Turn" and "Your Color" values
- The board should flip orientation after each move to show the active player's perspective
